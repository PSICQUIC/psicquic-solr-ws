# psicquic-solr-ws

This is the PSICQUIC Web Service Reference Implementation which is based on SOLR (an indexing software based on LUCENE). It can index MITAB 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 files. For information about how to install the web service, see [here](http://psicquic.github.io/HowToInstallPsicquicSolr.html). To query a PSICQUIC service with Java, there are two clients implemented (one uses [SOAP](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-client), the other [REST](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-simple-client)) as well as some client examples in [Perl](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws/tree/master/src/example/perl) and [Python](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws/tree/master/example/src/python).
